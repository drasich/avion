- must make editor api, for mesh test builder?
-> EDITOR LIB 

EDITOR_LIB
first build a static library that depends on joker, and later move dynamic part from it.

should/can be dynamic:
util
- control could be dynamic I guess...., it does save a state : CameraRotation, Dragger, MultipleSelection, but we could reset this, or separate the module in 2.
- model : of course dynamic


should be static to save state :
- context
- operation and undo stack : (should b if must save the stack between reload : static
otherwise clean the stack. we could add a closure type in the operation data to be more flexible.

don't know yet:
- all dragger stuff could be static for now, as I don't need to change it for now.
- ui start with static for now and move to dynamic?





BUG

PROPERTY
- press tab in property : focus is not working property : bug in phab
- add camera for scene in property show
- fix : camera properties are not showed...
- check if option some/none in property works correctly
- make display of property faster : create and save objects in a pool?
- transform property update_changed in propertyshow.update_widget

PROPERTY - SERIALIZATION
- object link
  -> be able to represent any struct with a widget, look at serde for more tricks


TREE
- tree selection is not working
- make tree a widget like property
- tree : make another widget to replace genlist tree? :
  change object order?
  change object parent,
  remove one object with suppr,
  remove all seleted object with suppr,
  rename object
  copy object

VIEW
- multiple view
- update input for gameview
- make camera view or just show the gameview while working.
- views update : scene changed so update the views.

RESOURCE SELECTION WIDGET
- resources : instead of writing the name make a selection window (and still be able to write the name)

SCRIPT
- investigate dyon
- investigate haskell + hint

OTHER
- clean code of update view when resource is done loading
- todo over operations
- represent the camera with somthing visible and selectable
  + differentiate between current camera and other cameras.
- be able to set camera of the scene -> scene settings (when nothing selected?)
- restore previous scene when closing the gameview.
- be able to save the current "playing scene"


- remove child of object : view dormin and how to change the scene.
  def.rs : remove_selected_objects, must save parents info, must check and not remove child if the parent will be removed anyway
  unless the scene structure changed we must remove children from the scene

- update material/shader in live, reread files.

TODO in def.rs

DONE?
uniforms in material

DONE
- id system

TODO
- save window pos/size, widget pos/size
- focus when writing data in entries

- when we changed property of a compdata, we have to reinit his components...
- separate texture and img

  - for each objects of the scene, keep a list of references of ui objects that use
  this objects, so when the objects changed we can update the ui.

- operation system / search for //TODO add operation
  - undo/redo
  - dragger


Components
- review component system
- lua component serialization?
