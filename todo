TODO
- add remove compdata, components

- when we changed property of a compdata, we have to reinit his components...
  for exemple in ui/property.rs "changed_set" function, 
  we are changing object/comp_data/MeshRender but it is not good
- separate texture and img
- transform property update_changed in propertyshow.update_widget

  - for each objects of the scene, keep a list of references of ui objects that use
  this objects, so when the objects changed we can update the ui.
